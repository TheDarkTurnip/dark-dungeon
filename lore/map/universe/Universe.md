# Creation

## The Spirits of Light and Dark

There was once the void, empty, silent, full of null pointers. And then suddenly, as if out of no where, a singular voice, starting singing. There was no origin to this voice, it was omnipresent. It just existed. The voice moved the void, and the void liked the singing, so it formed small beings, as to show appreciation to the singing. Once these small beings came to full form. The singing stopped. The voice, booming, shouted, "WHAT'S THERE?!". There was no immediate answer, until a singular word came from every voidling, "nothing." The voice spoke, as if to every infinite voidling, "You look lonely... here's a friend for you." And the suddenly, out of pitch black, came a shining angel. The voidlings scattered away. "Why are you running?" said the bright voice. "You're disgusting," said every voidling. At the heart of the illuminated humanoid, was a small sphere, constantly rotating, and giving off light. When the humanoid heard what the voidlings said, the sphere's rotations slowed, and the light dimmed. The voice, that once sang, said, "Don't worry little light, you're beautiful. These creatures simply cannot see." And with that, the humanoid once again shone brightly. The voidlings scattered even further away, all looking at the shining heart of the humanoid. "You're hurting us, you're too bright." said the voidlings. Suddenly, the voidlings started crawling to the humanoid. "Come here, let me tickle you.", said the innocent humanoid. As soon as the voidling touched the humanoid, its outstretched finer became blackened. The humanoid screeched in pain. "Why are you hurting my little light, void?" said the omnipresent voice. "It hurts us, you're too bright." replied the voidlings, still attacking the light humanoid. The voidlings were trying to cover the heart, the source of the light. Suddenly the humanoid figure that embodied the light sphere disappeared, only the sphere was left. The sphere rose into the air, out of reach of the voidlings. Similarly, the voidlings combined together, creating a spirit of darkness. The darkness charged at the spirit of light, and they entered an eternal battle. Sparks of darkness and light flew out of the battle, like fireworks. Eventually, the spirit moved so fast, they could only be perceived a single circle, chasing each other's tails. They were then encapsulated, in a bottle, by some unknown being, possibly the voice that sang, and teleported away, to the centre of the universe.

## The universe

![Universe Map](https://github.com/TheDarkTurnip/dark-dungeon/tree/master/lore/maps/universe/universe-map.png)

At the centre of the universe is the sun. In the centre of the sun, is the eternal spirits fight each other, light and dark. This creates the immense amount of light seen. Surrounding the sun, we have 4 planets, and then the infinite void. `Ramus Humum` is the most similar to Earth, and is where human's reside, and where the race of `turnips` once prospered. `Nixmundi`, the furthest planet, is also the coldest. `Ignisundim`, the "planet on fire", is the closest to the sun. And `Haranae`, is similar distance as `Ramus Humum`, but is covered in sand.
