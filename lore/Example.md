**Ancient Turnips**

They were once a race of people, who fought off against the evil forces of nature. Eventually, they became so invested in stopping nature, that they became part of nature.
And now we eat them for half a hunger point. However, some have found ways to enhance the turnip, bringing out its full potential, becoming the best food to eat.
