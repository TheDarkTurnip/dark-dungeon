# The First Inhabitants of `Ramus Humum`

The first inhabitants of Ramus Humum were humanoid-like. They were born out of the Earth, and developed simplistic languages between the different tribes spread throughout the lands. 
They had a very strong connection with nature, and mystical beings would come and visit them from time to time. 
From their stone drawings, they seemed to like fireflies, that would come down and float around them. 
The people worshiped themÂ likes gods, and it seems as if these fireflies rewarded them with magical gifts and prosperity.
