# Schlocius's greed

Schlocius was a notable being in the Pola tribe, the tribe best known for harnessing the powers of nature for technological progress. They were the first tribe to manipulate fire, and construct basic stone tools. 
Schlocius was experimenting with the fire, attempting to melt different things using a kiln that he had made.
One of the things he melted, was sand, and he was able to make glass.
Using this glass, he constructed a basic bowl, and a lid that he could later melt on top of the bowl.
He wanted to trap something in this bowl, and his finding of glass had attracted the "fireflies".
He trapped one of these fireflies, covered the top with his hand until he got the lid, and sealed the bowl shut.
He holds onto the trapped firefly for 5 years, using it to keep his path alight, until eventually, the firefly dies.
This act of entrapment displeased the powerful forces that govern life, and it was decided that all inhabitants would be turned into turnips.
He leaves the bowl to his only daughter, `Atronia`... who would later bury her own father, after becoming a turnip.
